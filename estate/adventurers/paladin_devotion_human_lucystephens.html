### Spellcasting

* **Spell Slots**: 2/0/0/0/0 (Regain all on Long Rest)
* **Spell Save DC**: 13, **Spell Attack Modifier**: +5 
* This character may prepare Cha Mod + (1/2 of Paladin Level, round down) spells from the Paladin Spell List
* **1st Level Spells**
  * (ACTION) **Cure Wounds.** A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. (One Target; Casting Time: 1 Action; Range: Touch; Components: V,S; Duration: Instant)
  * (BONUS ACTION) **Compelled Duel.** One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn. The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target. (One Target; Casting Time: 1 Bonus Action; Range: 30ft.; Components: V; Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute)
  * (BONUS ACTION) **Searing Smite.** The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to the target and causes the target to ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends. (One Target; Casting Time: 1 Bonus Action; Range: Self; Components: V; Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute)
  * (BONUS ACTION) **Shield of Faith.** A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration. (One Target; Casting Time: 1 Bonus Action; Range: 60ft.; Components: V,S,M; Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes)

### Feats

* (PASSIVE) **Sentinel**
  * When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
  * Creatures within 5 feet of you provoke opporlunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
  * When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking crealure.

### Equipment

* Longsword (Versatile), Shortsword (Finesse, Light), 5x Javelin (Thrown)
* Chainmail (Counts as a Holy Symbol of the Silver Flame, Aspect of Light)
