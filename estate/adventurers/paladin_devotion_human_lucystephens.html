* (ACTION) **Divine Sense.** 4/Long Rest; As an action, you can open your awareness to detect powerful forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* spell.
* (ACTION) **Lay on Hands.** 5 HP/Long Rest; As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multipIe diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

  * Creatures within 5 feet of you provoke opporlunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
  * When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking crealure.
