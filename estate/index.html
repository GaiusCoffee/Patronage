# Estate Phase

[Home](../) > Estate Phase

At the beginning of every in-game week, the following are done in order:

1. Check the **[Estate Events](../estate/events.html)** tables and resolve one random or scheduled event (skip this for the first week).
2. The Estate must total the amount of **Resources Gained** via its Assets as well as the previous Expedition.
3. The Estate must pay the **Upkeep** for the week; failure to do so puts the Estate into Debt.
4. The Estate may **Upgrade** its Assets*: see [Available Upgrades](../estate/upgrades). Note that some Upgrades are Exclusive, and can only be built by one Estate.
5. The Estate may **Dismiss** Adventurers.
6. The Estate may **Hire** [New Adventurers](../estate/adventurers) if they have available space in the Barracks. Adventurers always start at Level 1, and costs 1,000 ISC upfront.
7. The Estate may **Advance** Adventurers* to increase their in-game Level (see details below).
8. The Estate may **Requisition** Items*, such as Weapons, Armor, Shields, Tools, etc.
9. The Estate must choose an **Expedition**; The [Expedition Phase](../expedition) now begins.

*These actions can only be done if you are not in debt.

## The Starting Estate 

Each group of players in Patronage has joint control of an Estate. Each of these has a Manor, which is maintained by a Castellan and a small group of servants. There are also a small hamlet outside of the Manor, where a small population of citizens supports the Estate in exchange for protection.

Each Estate starts with the following resources:

* Resources
  * 20,000 ISC stored in the Manor Vault
* Assets
  * Manor
    * Upkeep: 100 ISC/week for the food and lodging of the Castellan and its servants, as well as maintenance of the structure
  * Barracks

    * Upkeep: 1000 ISC/week/Adventurer

## Advancing Adventurers

In order to 'Level Up' Adventurers, they must be Advanced at the beginning of the in-game week. Advancing Adventurers takes one week, which means that they are unavailable to use in an Expedition. It also costs the estate equal to 1000 ISC * the Adventurs's current level.
