# Patronage
A Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition Campaign, by [GM Erik](http://gaius.coffee).

> Dawn broke on the city of Scrygate, the seat of the Emperor and the largest city of The Dominion. Inside the Imperial Palace, Keiliah, the Voice of the Emperor, calls the Court into order. Courtiers, leaders  and advisors from all eight factions continue with their political machinations to shape their domains, gain power and resources and most importantly, increase their standing in the Court. You are currently in a curious position: you have gained enough standing to be invited to the Emperor's Court and help your Faction attain their goals. However, you are still new, having travelled from your Faction's domain with limited resources...  

Welcome to Patronage. This is a game one level above a typical pen and paper RPG. There will still be dungeon delving and dragon slaying, but the players will be the Patrons of the adventurers, the 'Quest givers', who are interested in gaining standing the Empire's Court.

## Game Overview

Each of the players will have Player Sheet that contains information about their faction and its current standing, the resources they have and the pawns they currently employ.

* [Player Sheet Template](players) & [The Empire's Calendar](calendar)
* North: [Jeff](), [Gibs](), [Mark](), [Edison](), [Paolo]() 
* South: [Jeff](), [Gibs](), [Francis](), [Nathan](), [Ado]()

At the start of every in-game week, each player may allocate resources during the **Imperial Court** phase of the game (see below). Resources, Standings and Pawns will be updated according to last in-game week, which can be instantly spent before the next phase begins.

After the Imperial Court phase, players will send their Pawns on **Expeditions**. The Empire strictly resticts these, so the North players and the South players can only send one expedition per in-game week. This forms a party of Pawns on the same quest, possibly with different agendas.
