# Patronage

Patronage is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition "Living" Campaign ran by [GM Erik](http://gaius.coffee). There are two groups of players, collectively known as YetAnother- the North Group (Jeff, Gibs, Nathan, Ado, Francis) and the South Group (Jeff, Gibs, Mark, Edison, Paolo). Patronage will be "Living" Campaign, where the decisions of one group will affect the other group, and possibly change the world itself.

## The Campaign World

Patronage exists in an infinite plane ruled by the Emperor, currently Empress Setsuna. The Imperial Seat are in the grand city of Gatescry, where the eight factions rule in the Court. The Church Argent is also based in this city, since the Emperor descended from the only diety in this plane: The Silver Flame. Even though there is only one religion, The Silver Flame has at least ten Aspects that the citizens worship individually. Divine magic exists in Patronage, but curiously, the Aspects of The Silver Flame does not allow resurrection of the dead. Arcane magic also exists in this world, but planar travel is limited. A curious kind of Arcane Magic known as Magitech is also becoming prevalent in the Central Dominance, and it is expected to spread quickly.

Immediately around Gatescry is the area known as the Central Dominance. No faction controls this area; it is owned by the Emperor's Lineage and policed by the Emperor's Imperial Army. To the eight directions around the Central Dominance are the Faction Territories. Outside the Central Dominance, numerous Estates dot the territories of the Factions. Each these estates are controlled by a family who are loyal (mostly) to the faction that controls the land, and surrounding each estate is a small community, a hamlet or a small town, that supports the industry of the Estate.

Each group of players in Patronage control an Estate. Every in-game week, they gather the resources (most probably in the form of ISC, or Imperial Silver Credits, the currency of the Empire) generated by the Estate, allocate them or store them for future use, then hire Adventurers to further their goals.
