# Expedition Phase

[Home](../) > Expedition Phase

At the end of every [Estate Phase](../estate), the players will choose an Expedition Destination to explore. While in the expedition, the Adventurers have exactly 6 days (six Long Rests) to clear the Expedition. If they fail to do so, then they die, and all loot are lost. In order to clear an Expedition, the Adventurers must accomplish at least one goal and return to the starting space.

### Allowed Expedition Destinations

Destinations are randomly generated, dungeon-like enviroments that the hired Adventurers explore.

Destination | Starting CR | Available Goals
------------|-------------|----------------
[The Surrounding Forest](forest1.html) | 1 | Exterminate, Elite Hunt

### Goals

* **Exterminate**
  * An Extermination goal means that the Adventurers must hunt a combined total CR equal to their highest level multiplied by seven.
* **Elite Hunt**
  * An Elite Hunt goal means that the Adventurers must hunt a specific Elite Monster (CR equal to their highest level plus two). This monster will be at or near the starting space after the Adventurers have hunted a combined total CR equal to their highest level multiplied by five.
