## Dungeon Generation

The Starting Area will always be a 20x20ft. square, with passages on three sides and last side granting access to the Estate's Hamlet. Adventurers on the Starting Area have access to the Estate's Weaponsmith, Armorsmith and Market (if they are built). 

Passages are always open air, with trees on both sides and unpassable undergrowth. The length and width of the passage varies, as well as the direction it continues on, but it will always have one entrance and one exit. At the end of every Passage, roll on the Clearings table below, then roll on the Clearing Contents table afterwards. The Chamber exits always connect to a passage, before going into another Clearing.

When going back through an already explored clearing, roll a d100: on 01-50, roll again on the Clearing Contents table. Do not do this if the players are attempting to 'farm' a clearing while avoiding escalation.
