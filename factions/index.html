# Factions
[Home](/) > Factions

## The Imperial Court

In order for laws to be passed or repealed in the Dominion, either the Emperor or one of the Eight Factions should propose the change. After one, two or three weeks, depending on the number of Domains affected, the Court will vote. Each of the Factions have one vote, except the current Favored faction which gets two votes. If a faction abstains from the vote (or cannot vote for whatever reason), then the Favored faction also decides on which way that faction votes. If a law recieves at least five of the nine votes, then the law passes and would be enforced after one week.

The Favored faction will always be one of the Eight Factions with the highest Standing with the Emperor when the Court opens.

## The Emperor's Lineage

The Emperor (or Empress) is a direct descendant of Argent, and serves as the Head of the Argent Church as well as the Arch Commander of the Imperial Army. The line of succession will always favor the eldest child of the sovereign to succeed the throne, regardless of gender or legality (law of absolute primogeniture); if there are none, then the nearest blood relative becomes Emperor.

Currently, **Empress Setsuna** sits upon the Imperial Throne, and her daughter Mikha is the Heiress-Apparent.
